The Regulatory Services group is comprised of three sections: Source Registration (Permitting), Facility Compliance and Enforcement, and Asbestos Control.

1. **Source Registration**

Source Registration is responsible for the review and approval/disapproval of applications for installation, modification, and operation of sources of air contaminant emissions within the City of Philadelphia. Source Registration activities include the review of applications pertaining to:

- Installation permits and operating licenses, as required under the Philadelphia Code.
- Plan approvals and operating permits, as required under *25 Pa. Code* Chapter 127.
- Title V, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), New Source Review (NSR), New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) permits, as required under the federal Clean Air Act.

State and federal permit requirements are administered and enforced locally pursuant to state and federal delegations of authority made to the City of Philadelphia. Source Registration is also responsible for the issuance of source or facility permit and license approval documents, as well as for conducting appropriate public notification and public involvement activities as may pertain to applications under review. This includes holding public and administrative hearings and preparing responses to comments received from the public. To minimize redundancy and paperwork burdens, Source Registration attempts, wherever possible, to consolidate local permit requirements with any state/federal permit requirements that may apply to a source or facility within Philadelphia.

Source Registration is also responsible for activities related to the stack testing of emission units and Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS). Stack testing activities include reviewing and approving test protocols, observing stack tests, and reviewing stack test reports. CEMS activities include reviewing and approving Phase I applications for the installation of new CEMS, observing parts of the Phase II performance testing for new CEMS, and reviewing Phase III CEMS performance test reports. Stack tests and CEMS must comply with *25 Pa. Code* Chapter 139, the Pennsylvania Source Test Manual, and the Pennsylvania Continuous Monitoring Manual, as well as any applicable EPA reference methods and performance specifications.

## Facility Compliance and Enforcement

Facility Compliance and Enforcement is responsible for the implementation of local, state, and federal regulatory requirements applicable to sources and facilities within Philadelphia. This includes conducting compliance assurance inspections at permitted facilities, maintaining citywide surveillance, and responding to citizen complaints regarding air pollution, noise, and vibration nuisances. Additionally, it involves pursuing appropriate enforcement actions to resolve violations, including entering into compliance agreements, filing for court-ordered consent decrees, and seeking injunctive actions in cases posing imminent endangerment to public health.

# Compliance Assurance and Enforcement

The Compliance Assurance unit, through its engineering staff, is responsible for monitoring source and facility compliance with regulatory and operating permit requirements. This includes preparing documentation for issuance of formal notices of violation (NOV) for verified non-compliance, identifying "significant violators" for resolution in accordance with U.S. EPA's Compliance Monitoring Strategy (CMS) and guidance, performing data collection and validation activities for maintenance of the air emissions inventory for Philadelphia, and providing appropriate information for uploading to the U.S. EPA's Air Information Retrieval (AIRS) facility compliance data system.

Compliance evaluation techniques utilized include conducting facility inspections, reviewing and auditing facility compliance certifications, testing of emissions and process materials, and engineering estimates and material balances. Compliance Assurance field inspectors, working in cooperation with the engineering staff, assist in performing compliance inspections for minor sources, in addition to their duties related to providing citywide emissions surveillance and complaint response. A field inspector is available on a 24-hour basis, on workdays, weekends, and holidays, either on active duty, standby, or emergency response mode. In addition to investigating complaints related to air pollution, noise, and vibration, field inspectors also respond to incidents involving possible leaking combustible gases and carbon monoxide from residential heating units, as well as providing appropriate assistance to first responders and incident commanders in events involving toxic or hazardous materials releases or spills.

The Enforcement unit is responsible for coordinating all enforcement activities of the AMS program. Cases that are determined appropriate for enforcement action are referred from the compliance evaluation and inspectional units for further action. Activities of the unit include:

- NOV preparation and issuance
- Case development and coordination with the city's Law Department
- Assessment of administrative penalties
- Negotiation of compliance agreements
- Enforcement coordination with the U.S. EPA, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), and the city's Environmental Task Force
- Prosecution of summary violations
- Development of enforcement protocols and procedures

## Asbestos Control

The Asbestos Control unit is responsible for implementation and enforcement of local, state, and federal requirements applicable to the control of emissions of asbestos and the regulation of the asbestos abatement industry. The unit, pursuant to local delegation of authority from the U.S. EPA, enforces the federal NESHAP for Asbestos at renovation and demolition sites. It also provides, via interagency agreement, local compliance oversight for the PA Department of Labor & Industry's certification requirements for asbestos workers and supervisors.

The Asbestos Control unit also administers and enforces the provisions of the Philadelphia Health Code pertaining to asbestos abatement project workplace standards, licensing of asbestos abatement contractors, certification of asbestos analytical laboratories, project inspectors, and investigators, and review and issuance of permits for major asbestos projects. The unit also develops and provides public distribution of information pertaining to asbestos control program activities and requirements, as well as asbestos-related health and safety advisory information for residents, school students, and building maintenance workers.

# Technical Services

The AMS Technical Services group, based at the AMS Laboratory, is responsible for the operation of the citywide air quality monitoring network; acquisition, quality assurance, and reporting of air quality data; and providing analytical laboratory and analytical methods development support to air quality monitoring activities, special air sampling studies, and to Regulatory Services' compliance assurance sampling and analysis programs. The Technical Services group is comprised of three sections: Air Monitoring, Computer Center, and Analytical Chemistry.

## 1. Air Monitoring

The Air Monitoring section is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the 11 air sampling sites (a twelfth site is being planned and will be added) comprising the citywide air monitoring network, including one Ncore-National Core multipollutant monitoring station measuring particles, Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Oxides, Lead, and basic meteorology, principally supporting research in air pollution control. The network is designed and equipped with instrumentation to provide measurements of ambient concentrations for seven federally-designated "criteria" air pollutants—air pollutants for which the U.S. EPA has established NAAQS—consisting of Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Lead, PM10 (respirable particulate matter less than 10 microns), and PM2.5 (fine particulate matter/aerosols less than 2.5 microns). The monitoring instruments employed conform with federal reference methods established nationally, and ambient measurements collected are used to determine the city's air quality status with regard to each of the federal NAAQS pollutants.

Data from continuous air sampling instruments operated at 5 of the sites are digitally transmitted over telephone lines to the AMS Laboratory, providing real-time access to air quality measurements for the four gaseous pollutants and a surrogate pollutant for particulate matter. The real-time data are employed to provide daily air quality reports to the public using the federal Air Quality Index or AQI. An intensive Photochemical Assessment Monitoring System, or PAMS project, has been instituted as part of a national initiative to measure ozone and ozone precursors during the "ozone season." In Philadelphia, the PAMS project is conducted during the months of June, July, and August at one site, and includes speciation of over 56 distinct organic compounds through analysis by gas chromatography.

Air Monitoring is also involved in providing support to special monitoring projects initiated both within AMS, for local air quality impact assessments, and externally by the U.S. EPA and other organizations, for purposes of monitoring methods development or data gathering for health effects studies or environmental characterizations. AMS also participates in the EPA Performance Evaluation Audit (Audit through-the-probe, or TTP) program run by the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS). OAQPS runs the PM2.5 performance evaluation program for AMS. Air Monitoring also maintains and calibrates portable sampling equipment used by inspectional staff within AMS' Regulatory Services and also that used by the Philadelphia Fire Department in responding to emergency situations.

## 2. Computer Center

# Computer Center Responsibilities

The Computer Center is responsible for providing data processing services for Technical Services' air monitoring and laboratory operations. These services include management of the ESC E-Data Acquisition System, SQL-Server, Oracle Server, File server, and twenty-four workstations with PCs. Computer Center personnel are responsible for hardware systems design and construction, program development and implementation, systems maintenance, database management and reporting, and user support through information distribution and training.

The majority of the activities of the Computer Center are devoted to supporting the air quality monitoring and data reporting systems required by federal regulations. A gas chromatograph, three liquid chromatographs, and an atomic absorption spectrophotometer are being interfaced with one of the scientific computer systems to increase productivity and ease data analysis and reporting workloads. The Computer Center also provides personal computer (PC) workstations for AMS Laboratory staff for use in word-processing, spreadsheet, and database applications. These PC systems are used for report writing, fiscal work, and general administrative functions performed at the AMS Laboratory.

# Analytical Chemistry

The Analytical Chemistry section is responsible for providing a wide range of laboratory services, involving support to air monitoring activities and performance of non-routine chemical analysis projects.

## Calibration Unit

The Calibration unit is responsible for performing required precision and accuracy checks on the air monitoring instruments deployed throughout the citywide network, including maintenance and flow checks on system auto-calibration equipment and performance of annual instrument audits using U.S. EPA-designated audit equipment. The Calibration unit also performs quarterly audits on particulate monitors. Responsibilities extend to general troubleshooting and maintenance of air monitoring equipment.

## General Chemistry Unit

The General Chemistry unit is responsible for weighing and analysis of filter samples obtained from the particulate monitoring instruments within the citywide network and for maintaining all required measurement records. In addition to performing gravimetric analysis of filters from PM10 and PM2.5 samplers, filters from high volume air samplers (HVAS), collecting total suspended particulates (TSP), are analyzed for lead plus seven other trace metals (chromium, cadmium, iron, manganese, nickel, zinc, copper). The unit also performs qualitative and quantitative analyses on soils, as well as on samples obtained from special purpose monitors (SPM) deployed for study purposes.

The General Chemistry unit maintains the capability for monitoring gross beta-radioactivity on TSP filters, performs measurements of conductivity and pH on precipitation samples collected during significant rainfall events, and conducts analyses of sulfur content in fuel oil samples taken to monitor compliance with the city's sulfur-in-fuel regulations. The unit is also responsible for performing general microscopy work related to identification and analysis of asbestos in bulk material samples collected by inspectors in the Asbestos Control unit; identification of particulate samples taken from areas impacted by soot falls, or other excessive particle deposition incidents, for purposes of determining possible responsible sources; and for providing pollen counts during the ragweed pollen season.

The Air Toxics unit is responsible for the collection (via sorbent tubes/canisters), preparation, identification, and analysis by GC/MS of air samples for a wide range of trace organic pollutants. Air sampling for formaldehyde (plus six other compounds) is conducted using a separate monitoring method, and analysis is performed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Air filters from five sites are sent to West Virginia for analysis of seven metals (Arsenic, Beryllium, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Manganese, and Nickel). The Air Toxics unit has also been involved in providing sample collection and analytical support to community exposure assessments and other special studies related to measuring ambient concentrations of certain toxic organic compounds in the vicinity of industrial or commercial sources.

# Emission Inventory and Reporting Requirements

Philadelphia County shall maintain a computerized emission inventory for all facilities classified as major facilities for Title V, Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), NSR, PSD, or any other categories of facilities identified by DEP. A current list of categories for the Southeast Region is attached as Appendix 1. DEP will notify Philadelphia County of any changes to the list at least 90 days prior to the next reporting period and allow Philadelphia County 60 days for review and comment. Philadelphia County shall update the inventory at the frequency specified in DEP's Rules and Regulations. The inventory will have sufficient detail to determine the potential and actual emission rates from each source for CO, NOx, SOx, VOC, PM10, PM2.5, and the Section 112(b) air toxic pollutants. The inventory shall detail actual throughput rates for each source on a monthly basis unless otherwise agreed upon by DEP and Philadelphia County.

## Emission Statements

Philadelphia County shall require an annual emission statement from facilities which emit VOC or NOx. If the facility category is listed on the exemption list published at 23 Pa. Bulletin 1994-1995, then only those facilities with an actual emission rate of 25 tons per year or more of VOC or NOx need to submit a statement. The emission statement must indicate the actual emission rates of VOC and NOx, the method used to calculate the emissions, and a certification by a company officer or plant manager that the information is accurate. The average pounds per day must not be diluted by non-operational periods during the ozone season. The statement shall be required by March 1 for the preceding calendar year. Philadelphia County shall enter the actual emissions from each facility into the computerized emission inventory on an annual basis.

## Emission Reporting Requirements

Philadelphia County shall provide the following to DEP on an annual basis using a method mutually agreed upon by both agencies:

## Appendix 1

### Guidance for Determining Which Facilities Belong in AIMS for Inventory Purposes

These guidelines are a synthesis of the inventory requirements of Title V, the Annual Inventory, Emission Statements, and other regulations that are part of the SIP. The Title V regulations are found in the Pennsylvania Code, Title 25, Chapter 127. The Annual Inventory regulation is found in the Pennsylvania Code, Title 25, Chapter 135.1-135.5. The Emission Statement regulation is found in the Pennsylvania Code, Title 25, Chapter 135.21. Title V major source definitions can be found in the Pennsylvania Code, Title 25, Chapter 121.1. Exemptions from state operating permits can be found on page 4559 of the September 21, 1996 Pennsylvania Bulletin.

Facilities that wish to generate or trade Emission Reduction Credits (ERC) will need to document emissions. The annual inventory report is one way to document emissions. All facilities have the option of submitting annual inventory reports for ERC purposes. If the facility does not submit annual inventory data, the facility should at least maintain sufficient production records to be able to reconstruct emissions for ERC purposes.

The emissions from any facility that is not required to submit annual inventory forms are captured in the area source inventory, which is calculated using demographics and emission factors. For information on area source inventory, contact the Bureau of Air Quality's Air Information Management Section at (717) 783-9241.

Any emissions that are below the source reporting thresholds for facilities that are subject to the annual inventory will be calculated by the Bureau of Air Quality using emission factors. Facilities have the option of submitting emission estimates for emissions below the source thresholds if the owner/operator of the company's estimate is better than the factor-generated numbers.

## A. Title V Facilities

The owners/operators of all Title V facilities must complete the annual inventory reporting forms. Title V facilities are subject because, by definition, they exceed the reporting thresholds in the Emission Statement and SIP regulations. Inventory information from Title V facilities is used for emission fee purposes and to demonstrate compliance.

Title V facilities report emissions from all sources, as the sources are defined in the Title V permit. In some cases, the Title V permit treats multiple pieces of related equipment as one source. This treatment is negotiated between the facility and DEP inventory and permit staff. Actual emissions of 1.0 tons per year or more per source must be reported for all criteria pollutants and 0.5 tons per year of HAPs, except for the HAPs of special concern listed below. Reports should round to the nearest one-hundredth of a ton. All emissions must be reported source by source, not as site totals. HAPs must be reported individually (speciated). Source by source speciated reporting of HAPs is required for Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) purposes. In cases where HAPs are also VOCs or particulates, do not subtract the HAP emission estimates from the VOC or particulate emission estimates. The subtraction will be dealt with by the AIMS database.

Based upon the Federal Clean Air Act, Section 112(c)(6), certain pollutants and sources are of special concern. The following thresholds apply for boilers greater than 2.5 MMBtu, incinerators, lead handling operations, and utilities:

| Pollutant | Threshold (TPY per source) |
| :-------------------- | :------------ |
| Polychlorobiphenols (PCB) | 0.01 |
| Lead (Pb) | 0.01 |
| Polycyclic Organic Matter (POM) | 0.01 |
| Dioxins | 0.00001 |
| Furans | 0.00001 |
| Mercury (Hg) non-coal fired electric generating units (EGU) | 0.0005 |
| Mercury (Hg) coal fired EGUs | 0.0001 |
| Mercury (Hg) all other types of sources | 0.01 |

## B. Synthetic Minor Facilities

NOx and VOC data may be required for Emission Statements and ozone calculations. Synthetic minor facilities may be required to complete annual inventory reporting forms when NOx and/or VOC emissions are generated. Facilities are subject if actual VOC emissions are greater than or equal to 10 TPY for the site and/or if actual NOx emissions are greater than or equal to 25 TPY for the site. Actual emissions of 1.0 TPY or more per source must be reported for NOx and/or VOC, whichever made the facility subject to reporting. Reports should round to the nearest one-hundredth of a ton. All emissions must be reported source by source, not as site totals.

For example, if a facility has 12 TPY of actual VOC emissions and 20 TPY of actual NOx emissions, the facility must report VOCs from any source that emitted 1 TPY or more. Any sources that emit NOx are not required to be reported, as the facility's NOx emissions are below the threshold. If the facility has 12 TPY of actual VOC emissions and 26 TPY of actual NOx emissions, the facility must report both VOCs and NOx.

Emission estimates for other pollutants will be calculated by DEP's AIMS database using emission factors associated with source classification codes (SCC). The facility owner/operator has the option of reporting emission estimates for other pollutants if the facility's estimates are better than the SCC-based calculations.

Synthetic minor facilities must certify and/or demonstrate that the permit caps have not been exceeded. The certification/demonstration does not require source-by-source reporting of operating data and emission estimates using the annual inventory forms. The facility has the option of completing the annual inventory forms to demonstrate compliance with the caps for any pollutants. If the facility does not submit annual inventory forms, the facility owner/operator must arrange with Philadelphia County or DEP regional staff for an alternate demonstration of synthetic minor status. The regional staff will use the demonstration data to calculate site total emission estimates and enter these estimates into AIMS. If an existing permit caps a specific source, emissions from the capped source would have to be reported separately from any site totals. Electronic submission of alternate demonstration data may not be possible.

### C. Natural Minor with a State Operating Permit

NOx and VOC data may be required for Emission Statements and ozone calculations. The owners/operators of natural minor facilities with operating permits may be required to complete annual inventory reporting forms when NOx and/or VOC emissions are generated. Facilities are subject if actual VOC emissions are greater than or equal to 10 TPY for the site. Facilities are also subject if actual NOx emissions are greater than or equal to 25 TPY for the site. The facility owner/operator must report only NOx and/or VOCs, whichever made the facility subject to reporting. Actual emissions of 1.0 ton per year or more per source must be reported for all criteria pollutants and 0.5 tons per year of HAPs. Reports should round to the nearest one-hundredth of a ton. All emissions must be reported source by source, not as site totals. See the example for Synthetic Minors. Emission estimates for other pollutants will be calculated by the AIMS database using SCCs. The facility has the option of reporting emission estimates for other pollutants if the facility's estimates are better than the SCC-based calculations.

If the facility only generates SOx, PM, CO, and/or HAPs, or if the facility generates NOx and VOC and both are below the thresholds, the facility is not subject to the inventory.

### D. Natural Minors Exempted from State Operating Permit

These facilities are not required to submit annual inventory forms. The emissions from these facilities are captured in the area source inventory.

The hearing board shall have the power and duty to hear and determine all appeals from appealable actions of the department as defined in the act of July 13, 1988 (P.L.530, No.94), known as the "Environmental Hearing Board Act," in accordance with the provisions of this act. Any action taken by the hearing board with reference to any such appeal shall be in the form of an adjudication, and all such action shall be subject to the provisions of 2 Pa.C.S. (relating to administrative law and procedure).

*(6 amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)*

## Plan Approvals and Permits

### Construction and Modification

(a) No person shall construct, assemble, install, or modify any stationary air contamination source, or install any air pollution control equipment or device unless such person has applied to and received written plan approval from the department. However, no such written approval shall be necessary for normal routine maintenance operations, nor for any source, equipment, or device used solely for supplying heat or hot water to a one-family or two-family dwelling, nor where construction, assembly, installation, or modification is specifically authorized by the rules or regulations of the department to be conducted without written approval. All applications for approval shall be made in writing, on forms prescribed by the department, and shall include detailed plans and specifications related to the proposed installation.

### Operating Permits

(b) 
1. No person shall operate any stationary air contamination source unless the department has issued a permit to operate such source in response to a written application submitted on forms and containing information as prescribed by the department. The department shall provide public notice and the right to comment on all permits prior to issuance or denial and may hold public hearings concerning any permit.

2. A permit may be issued after the effective date of this amendment to any applicant for a stationary air contamination source.

Ensure that any air contamination source requiring construction, assembly, installation, or modification meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this section. A test operation or evaluation must be performed to satisfy the department that the source will not discharge air contaminants into the outdoor atmosphere at a rate exceeding that permitted by applicable regulations of the board. It must also comply with any performance or emission standard or other requirement established by the Environmental Protection Agency or the department for such a source, ensuring it will not cause air pollution.

3. **Stationary Air Contamination Source Operating Without a Permit**

   A stationary air contamination source operating lawfully without a permit, for which fees required by section 6.3 of this act or the regulations promulgated under this act have been paid, is authorized to continue operating without a permit until 120 days after the department provides notice that a permit is required or until November 1, 1996, whichever occurs first. If the applicant submits a complete permit application within the specified time frames and the department fails to issue a permit through no fault of the applicant, the source may continue to operate if the fees required by section 6.3 or the regulations promulgated under this act have been paid. The source must be operated in conformance with this act, the Clean Air Act, and the regulations promulgated under both acts. For any performance or emission standard or other requirement established by the Environmental Protection Agency or the department for the source subsequent to the effective date of this act but prior to the permit issuance date, the permit may contain a compliance schedule authorizing the source to operate out of compliance and requiring the source to achieve compliance as soon as possible but no later than the time required by this act, the Clean Air Act, or the regulations promulgated under either act. A source is operating lawfully without a permit if it is a source for which no permit was previously required and is operating in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

4. **Repermitting of Stationary Air Contamination Sources**

   For repermitting any stationary air contamination source operating under a valid permit on the effective date of this act or which has received a permit under the provisions of clauses (2) and (3) of this subsection, and which is required to meet performance or emission standards or other requirements established subsequent to the issuance of the existing permit, the new permit may contain a compliance schedule authorizing the source to operate out of compliance and requiring the source to achieve compliance as soon as possible but no later than the time required by this act, the Clean Air Act, or the regulations promulgated under either act.

### Permit or Plan Approval Conditions

(b.1) A permit or plan approval issued hereunder may contain terms and conditions deemed necessary by the department to assure the proper operation of the source. The board shall establish a permit shield for permits issued under the authority delegated to the Commonwealth by the EPA under Title V of the Clean Air Act. The program shall be consistent with the requirements of section 504(f) of the Clean Air Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Each permittee, on a schedule established by the department, shall submit reports to the department containing information as prescribed relative to the operation and maintenance of the source.

### (b.2) Permit Issuance and Terms

A permit issued or reissued under subsection (b) of this section shall be issued for a five (5) year term unless a shorter term is required to comply with the Clean Air Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, or the permittee requests a shorter term. However, a permit for acid deposition control shall be issued for a five (5) year term. A permit may be terminated, modified, suspended, or revoked and reissued for cause. The terms and conditions of an expired permit are automatically continued pending the issuance of a new permit where the permittee has submitted a timely and complete application for a new permit and paid the fees required by section 6.3 or the regulations promulgated under this act. If the department is unable, through no fault of the permittee, to issue or deny a new permit before the expiration date of the previous permit, this shall be an appealable action as described in section 10.2. The hearing board may require that the department take action on an application without additional delay.

### (b.3) Application Procedures

The board shall by regulation establish adequate, streamlined, and reasonable procedures for expeditiously determining when applications are complete and for expeditious review of applications. The department shall approve or disapprove a complete application, consistent with the procedures established by the board for consideration of such applications, within eighteen (18) months after the date of receipt of the complete application. However, the department shall establish a phased schedule for acting on permit applications submitted within the first full year after the effective date of the Title V permit program established to implement the requirements of the Clean Air Act. The schedule shall assure that at least one-third of such permits shall be acted upon by the department annually over a period not to exceed three (3) years after such effective date. Failure of the department to issue or deny a permit by a deadline established by this subsection shall be an appealable action as described in section 10.2 of this act. The hearing board may require that the department take action on an application without additional delay.

### (b.4) Reactivation of Sources

1. During the term of a permit, a permittee may reactivate any source under the permit that has been out of operation or production for a period of one year or more, provided that the permittee has submitted a reactivation plan to and received written approval from the department. The reactivation plan shall describe the measures that will be taken to ensure the source will be reactivated in compliance with all applicable permit requirements. A reactivation plan may be submitted to and approved by the department at any time during the term of a permit. The department shall take action on the reactivation plan within thirty (30) days unless the department determines that additional time is needed based on the size or complexity of the reactivated source.

2. A reactivation plan may also be submitted to and approved by the department as part of the plan approval or permit application process. An owner or operator who has an approved reactivation plan shall notify the department prior to the reactivation of the source.

### (b.5) Adoption of Regulations

The board shall adopt the regulations required by subsections (b.1), (b.3), and (i) as part of the regulatory package to implement the operating permit program required by Title V of the Clean Air Act.

(c) A plan approval or permit issued hereunder may be terminated, modified, suspended, or revoked and reissued if the permittee constructs or operates the source subject to the plan approval or permit in such a manner as to be in violation of this act, the Clean Air Act, the regulations promulgated under either this act or the Clean Air Act, a plan approval or permit, or in such a manner as to cause air pollution. This may also occur if the permittee fails to properly or adequately maintain or repair any air pollution control device or equipment attached to or otherwise made a part of the source, if the permittee has failed to submit a report required by a plan approval or operating permit under this section, or if the Environmental Protection Agency determines that the permit is not in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act or the regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act.

(d) The department may refuse to grant plan approval for any stationary air contamination source subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section or to issue a permit to any source that the department determines is likely to cause air pollution or to violate this act, the Clean Air Act, or the regulations promulgated under either this act or the Clean Air Act applicable to such source. This refusal may also occur if, in the design of such source, no provision is made for adequate verification of compliance, including source testing or alternative means to verify compliance. The department may also refuse to issue a permit or may, for cause, terminate or revoke and reissue any permit to any person if the Environmental Protection Agency determines that the permit is not in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act or the regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act, or if the applicant has constructed, installed, modified, or operated any air contamination source or installed any air pollution control equipment or device on such source contrary to the plans and specifications approved by the department.

(e) Whenever the department shall refuse to grant an approval or to issue or reissue a permit hereunder or terminate, modify, suspend, or revoke a plan approval or permit already issued, such action shall be in the form of a written notice to the person affected thereby informing them of the action taken by the department and setting forth, in such notice, a full and complete statement of the reasons for such action. Such notice shall be served upon the person affected, either personally or by certified mail, and the action set forth in the notice shall be final and not subject to review unless, within thirty (30) days of the service of such notice, any person affected thereby shall appeal to the hearing board, setting forth with particularity the grounds relied upon. The hearing board shall hear the appeal pursuant to the provisions of the rules and regulations relating to practice and procedure before the hearing board, and thereafter, shall issue an adjudication affirming, modifying, or overruling the action of the department.

(f) The department may by regulation establish a general plan approval and a general permit program. After the program is established, the department may grant general plan approval or a general permit for any category of stationary air contamination source if the department determines that the sources in such category are similar in nature and can be adequately regulated using standardized specifications and conditions. Any applicant proposing to use a general plan approval or general permit shall notify the department and receive written approval prior to the proposed use. The department shall take action on a notification within thirty (30) days.

(g) The department may by regulation establish a plan approval and permit program for stationary sources operated at multiple temporary locations. After the program is established, the department may grant a plan approval or issue a single permit to any stationary air contamination source that may be operated at multiple temporary locations. Such approval or permit shall require the owner or operator to notify the department and municipality where the operation shall take place in advance of each change in location and may require a separate application and permit or approval fee for operations at each location. Any applicant proposing to use the plan approval or permit authorized by this subsection shall notify the department and receive written approval prior to the proposed use. The department shall take action on a request within thirty (30) days.

(h) The department shall establish comprehensive plan approval and operating permit programs which meet the requirements of this act and the Clean Air Act.

(i) The board shall by regulation establish provisions to allow changes within a permitted facility or one operating pursuant to clause (3) of subsection (b) of section 6.1 without requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any provision of 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85 Subch. I (relating to programs and activities) and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in terms of total emissions, provided that the facility provides the administrator and the department with written notification at least seven (7) days in advance of the proposed changes, unless the board provides in its regulations a different time frame for emergencies.

(j) The department shall make available to the public any permit application, compliance plan, permit and monitoring or compliance report required by this act.

(k) The department shall require revisions to any permit to incorporate applicable standards and regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act after the issuance of such permit. Such revisions shall occur as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than eighteen (18) months after the promulgation of such standards and regulations. No such revision shall be required if the effective date of the standards or regulations is a date after the expiration of the permit term or if less than three (3) years remain on the permit. Such permit revision shall be treated as a permit renewal if it complies with the requirements of this act regarding renewals.

(6.1 amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)

## Section 6.2. Emergency Procedure

(a) Any other provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, if the department finds, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the board adopted under the provisions of clause (5) of section 5 of this act, that a generalized condition of air pollution exists and that it creates an emergency requiring immediate action to protect human health or safety, the department, with the concurrence of the Governor, shall order or direct persons causing or contributing to the air pollution to immediately reduce or discontinue the emission of air contaminants.

((a) amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)

(b) In the absence of a generalized condition of air pollution, if the department finds that emissions from the operation of one or more air contamination sources are creating...

an imminent danger to human health or safety, the department may, without regard to the provisions of section 4 of this act, order the persons responsible for the operation of the air contamination sources in question to immediately reduce or discontinue the emission of air contaminants.

(c) An order issued under subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall fix a place and time, not later than twenty-four hours thereafter, for a hearing to be held before the hearing board. Within twenty-four hours after the commencement of such hearing, and without adjournment thereof, the hearing board shall affirm, modify, or set aside the order of the department.

(d) This section shall not be construed to limit any power which the Governor or any other officer may have to declare an emergency and act on the basis of such declaration.

*(6.2 added Oct. 26, 1972, P.L.989, No.245)*

## Section 6.3. Fees

(a) This section authorizes the establishment of fees sufficient to cover the indirect and direct costs of administering the air pollution control plan approval process, operating permit program required by Title V of the Clean Air Act, other requirements of the Clean Air Act, and the indirect and direct costs of administering the Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program, Compliance Advisory Committee, and Office of Small Business Ombudsman. This section also authorizes the board by regulation to establish fees to support the air pollution control program authorized by this act and not covered by fees required by section 502(b) of the Clean Air Act.

(b) An annual interim air emission fee of fourteen dollars ($14.00) per ton on emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter of ten (10) microns or less, and volatile organic compounds is hereby established to cover the reasonable direct and indirect costs of developing and administering the air pollution control operating permit program required by Title V of the Clean Air Act, other requirements of the Clean Air Act, and the reasonable indirect and direct costs of administering the Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program, Compliance Advisory Committee, and the Office of Small Business Ombudsman to be collected during fiscal year 1992-1993 covering actual emissions occurring in calendar year 1991, fiscal year 1993-1994 covering actual emissions occurring in calendar year 1992, and fiscal year 1994-1995 covering actual emissions occurring during calendar year 1993. The interim fee shall not apply to air emissions of less than one hundred (100) tons for any of the listed pollutants, provided that when emissions exceed one hundred (100) tons, the entire amount of all air emissions for any of the listed pollutants up to five thousand five hundred (5,500) tons shall be chargeable emissions for interim fee purposes.

(c) The board shall establish by regulation a permanent annual air emission fee as required for regulated pollutants by section 502(b) of the Clean Air Act to cover the reasonable direct and indirect costs of administering the operating permit program required by Title V of the Clean Air Act, other related requirements of the Clean Air Act, and the reasonable indirect and direct costs of administering the Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program, Compliance Advisory Committee, and the Office of Small Business Ombudsman to be collected starting in fiscal year 1995-1996 covering air emissions occurring during calendar year 1994. In no case shall the amount of the permanent fee be more...

than that which is necessary to comply with section 502(b) of the Clean Air Act. The permanent fee shall not apply to emissions of more than four thousand (4,000) tons for any regulated pollutant. In the event a final regulation containing the permanent annual air emission fee is not effective by July 1, 1995, the permanent annual air emission fee for sources subject to the Title V operating permit program shall be the adjusted minimum dollar amount set under section 502(b) of the Clean Air Act until such time as the final regulation is effective.

### (d) Establishment of Permanent Air Emission Fee

Unless precluded by the Clean Air Act, the board shall establish a permanent air emission fee which considers:

- The size of the air contamination source
- The resources necessary to process the application for plan approval or an operating permit
- The complexity of the plan approval or operating permit
- The quantity and type of emissions from the sources
- The amount of fees charged in neighboring states
- The importance of not placing existing or prospective sources in this Commonwealth at a competitive disadvantage
- Other relevant factors

### (e) Interim Fees

Until alternative fees are established by the board under subsection (c) of this section, stationary air contamination sources shall pay the following interim fees:

1. Two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the processing of an application for an operating permit.
2. Two hundred dollars ($200.00) for annual operating permit administration fee.

### (f) Exemption for State Entities

No emissions fee established under subsection (b), (c), or (j) of this section shall be payable by any State entity, instrumentality, or political subdivision in relation to any publicly owned or operated facility.

### (g) Use of Fees in Local Programs

Any fees imposed under this section in areas with approved local air pollution control programs shall be deposited in a restricted account established by the governing body authorizing the local program for use by that program to implement the provisions of this act for which they are responsible. The governing body shall annually submit to the department an audit of the account to ensure the funds were properly spent.

### (h) Payment Schedule and Penalties

1. Unless the board establishes a different payment schedule by regulation, each facility subject to the emission fees established in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall report its emissions and pay the fee within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of a reporting form from the department or by September 1 of each year for the emission from the preceding year, whichever occurs first.

2. An air contamination source that fails to pay the fees within the time frame established by this act or by regulation shall pay a penalty of fifty percent (50%) of the fee amount, plus interest on the fee amount computed in accordance with section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Public Law 99-514, 26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) from the date the fee was required to be paid. In addition, such source may have its permit terminated or suspended. The fee, penalty, and interest may be collected following the process for assessment and collection of a civil penalty contained in section 9.1.

### (i) Adjustment of Permanent Air Emission Fee

The permanent air emission fee imposed under subsection (c) shall be increased in each year after implementation of the fee by regulation by the percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index for the most recent calendar year exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year 1989. For purposes of this subsection:

### Section 6.3: Consumer Price Index and Fees

1. **Consumer Price Index**  
   The Consumer Price Index for any calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for All-Urban Consumers, published by the United States Department of Labor, as of the close of the twelve (12) month period ending on August 31 of each calendar year.

2. **Revision Consistency**  
   The revision of the Consumer Price Index which is most consistent with the Consumer Price Index for calendar year 1989 shall be used.

3. **Fee Categories**  
   The board may by regulation establish the following categories of fees not related to Title V of the Clean Air Act. Until such regulations are adopted, stationary air contamination sources shall pay the following fees:
   - Two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the processing of any application for plan approval.
   - Two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the processing of any application for an operating permit.
   - Two hundred dollars ($200.00) for annual operating permit administration fee.

   In regard to fees established under this subsection, individual sources required to be regulated by Title V of the Clean Air Act shall only be subject to plan approval fees authorized in this subsection.

4. **Fee Deposit and Usage**  
   No administrative action shall prevent the deposit of the fees established pursuant to this section in the Clean Air Fund established in section 9.2 during the fiscal year in which they are collected. The fees shall only be used for the purposes authorized in this section and section 9.2 and shall not be transferred or diverted to any other purpose by administrative action.

5. **Delinquent Payments**  
   Any fees, penalties, and interest owed to the Commonwealth for delinquent payment collected under this section shall be deposited in the Clean Air Fund.

6. **Definition of Regulated Pollutant**  
   As used in this section, the term "regulated pollutant" shall mean a volatile organic compound, each pollutant regulated under sections 111 and 112 of the Clean Air Act, and each pollutant for which a national primary ambient air quality standard has been promulgated, except that carbon monoxide shall be excluded from this reference.

*(6.3 added July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)*

### Section 6.4: Fee for Certain Ozone Areas

(a) **Ozone Nonattainment Area Fee**  
   If an area identified in a State implementation plan or any revision as a severe or extreme ozone nonattainment area has failed to meet the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone by the applicable attainment date, each major source of volatile organic compounds (VOC's), as defined in the Clean Air Act and the regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act, located in the area shall, except with respect to emissions during any year treated as an extension year under section 181(a)(5) of the Clean Air Act, pay a fee to the department as a penalty for such failure for each calendar year beginning after the attainment date until the area is redesignated as an attainment area for ozone. This fee shall be assessed and collected following the process for collection and assessment of a civil penalty contained in section 9.1.

(b) **Fee Calculation**  
   1. The fee shall equal five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), adjusted in accordance with clause (3) of this subsection, per ton of VOC emitted by the source during the calendar year in excess of eighty percent (80%) of the baseline amount, computed under clause (2) of this subsection. The fee shall be in addition to all other fees required to be paid by the source.

(2) **(i)** For purposes of this section, the baseline amount shall be computed, in accordance with such guidance as the administrator may provide, as the lower of the amount of actual VOC emissions (referred to as actuals) or VOC emissions allowed under the permit applicable to the source or, if no such permit has been issued for the attainment year, the amount of VOC emissions allowed under the applicable implementation plan (referred to as allowables) during the attainment year.

**(ii)** Notwithstanding subclause (i) of this clause, the administrator may issue guidance authorizing the baseline amount to be determined in accordance with the lower of average actuals or average allowables determined over a period of more than one (1) calendar year. This guidance may provide that the average calculation for a specific source may be used if that source's emissions are irregular, cyclical, or otherwise vary significantly from year to year.

(3) The fee amount under clause (1) of this subsection shall be adjusted annually, beginning 1991, in accordance with subsections (h) and (i) of section 6.3.

(c) For areas with a total population under two hundred thousand (200,000) which fail to attain the standard by the applicable attainment date, no sanction under this section or under any other provisions of this act shall apply if the area can demonstrate, consistent with guidance issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, that attainment in the area is prevented because of ozone or ozone precursors transported from other areas. The prohibition applies only in cases in which the area has met all requirements and implemented all measures applicable to the area under the Clean Air Act.

*(6.4 added July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)*

## Section 6.5. Acid Deposition Control

(a) The department is authorized to develop a permit program for acid deposition control in accordance with Titles IV and V of the Clean Air Act and to submit it to the administrator for approval.

(b) For purposes of the permit program authorized under subsection (a) of this section, the definitions in sections 402 and 501 of the Clean Air Act are incorporated herein by reference.

(c) The owner or operator or the designated representative of each source affected under section 405 of the Clean Air Act shall submit a permit application and compliance plan for the affected source to the department no later than January 1, 1996. In the case of affected sources for which application and plans are timely received, the permit application and the compliance plan, including amendments thereto, shall be binding on the owner or operator or the designated representative of the owners or operators and shall be enforceable as a permit for purposes of this section until a permit is issued by the department. Any permit issued by the department shall require the source to achieve compliance as soon as possible but no later than the date required by this act, the Clean Air Act, or the regulations promulgated under either this act or the Clean Air Act for the source.

(d) At any time after the submission of a permit application and compliance plan, the applicant may submit a revised application and compliance plan. In considering any permit application and compliance plan under this section, the department shall coordinate with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission consistent with requirements that may be established by the administrator.

(e) In addition to other provisions, permits issued by the department shall prohibit all of the following:

1. **Annual Emissions Violations**  
   - Emissions of sulfur dioxide exceeding the number of allowances held by the owner, operator, or designated representative for the unit.
   - Exceedances of applicable emissions rates or standards, including ambient air quality standards.
   - Use of any allowance prior to the year for which it is allocated.
   - Contravention of any other provision of the permit.

   *(6.5 added July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)*

## Section 6.6. Hazardous Air Pollutants

(a) The regulations establishing performance or emission standards promulgated under section 112 of the Clean Air Act are incorporated by reference into the department's permitting program. After the effective date of the performance or emission standard, new, reconstructed, modified, and existing sources shall comply with the performance or emission standards pursuant to the compliance schedule established under section 112 of the Clean Air Act and the regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act. The Environmental Quality Board may not establish a more stringent performance or emission standard for hazardous air pollutant emissions from existing sources, except as provided in subsection (d). This section shall not apply to rules and regulations adopted as final prior to the effective date of this act and shall not be construed to weaken standards for individual sources or facilities in effect prior to the effective date of this act. The board may establish performance or emission standards for sources or categories of sources which are not included on the list of source categories established under section 112(c) of the Clean Air Act. For purposes of this section, the term "performance standard" includes design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards or any combination thereof.

(b) In the event the administrator has not promulgated a standard to control the emissions of hazardous air pollutants for a category or subcategory of major sources under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, pursuant to a schedule established pursuant to section 112(c) of the Clean Air Act, the department shall have the authority to establish a performance or emission standard on a case-by-case basis for individual sources or a category of sources. The department shall have the authority to make the determinations required by section 112(g)(2) of the Clean Air Act regarding the construction, reconstruction, and modification of sources. Any person challenging the performance or emission standards established by the department shall have the burden to demonstrate that the performance or emission standard does not meet the requirements of section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The department shall incorporate the standard to control the emissions of hazardous air pollutants into the plan approval or operating permit of any source within the category or subcategory. The performance or emission standard established on a case-by-case basis by the department shall be equivalent to the limitation that would apply to the source if a performance or emission standard had been promulgated by the administrator under section 112 of the Clean Air Act.

(c) The department is authorized to require that new sources demonstrate in the plan approval application that the source will reduce or control emissions of air pollutants, including hazardous air pollutants, by using the best available technology.

(d) 
1. When needed to protect public health, welfare, and the environment from emissions of hazardous air pollutants from new and existing sources, the department may impose health...

In developing health risk-based emission standards or operating practice requirements, the department shall provide an explanation and rationale for such standards or requirements. It must also allow for public review and comments on plan approvals, operating permits, guidelines, and regulations containing these standards or requirements. The standards or requirements adopted under this subsection should be developed using an analysis that considers, among other factors, the criteria set forth in section 112(f)(1) of the Clean Air Act. This is to assess the proposed risk to public health, welfare, and the environment from the source.

1. **Coke Oven Batteries:**
   - The department may not impose health risk-based emission standards more stringent than Federal requirements until eight years after the promulgation of maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards. Additionally, this cannot occur until the year 2020 for coke oven batteries that satisfy the requirements of section 112(l)(8)(A) of the Clean Air Act.
   - Notwithstanding the above limitation, if the operation of a coke oven battery results in serious, substantial, and demonstrable harm to public health, welfare, and the environment, the department may impose health risk-based emission standards by regulation. These standards should utilize proven, commercially available, and economically feasible methods of technology.

2. **Implementation Timeline:**
   - The department shall not impose health risk-based emission standards until after January 1, 1998, for coke oven batteries that satisfy the applicable MACT or lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) standards.
   - After January 1, 1998, the department shall only impose health risk-based emission standards adopted pursuant to section 112(f) of the Clean Air Act. If no such standards are adopted, the department may adopt standards consistent with the criteria and factors set forth in clause (1) and section 112(f) of the Clean Air Act, until such time as Federal standards are enacted.

3. **Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - The department has the authority to require reasonable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for sources emitting hazardous air pollutants in the plan approval and operating permit.

4. **Emergency Actions:**
   - Nothing in this section precludes the department from taking emergency action where there is an immediate or potential threat to public health, welfare, and the environment from an air pollutant, including a hazardous air pollutant.

5. **Early Emissions Reduction Program:**
   - The early emissions reduction program authorized under section 112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act is incorporated by reference in the department's permitting program.

### Section 6.7. Control of Volatile Organic Compounds from Gasoline-Dispensing Facilities
- (6.7 repealed July 5, 2012, P.L.1109, No.135)

### Section 7. Public Hearings
- **(a)** Public hearings shall be held by the board or by the department, acting on behalf and at the direction or request of the board, in any region of the Commonwealth affected before any rules or regulations are established.

When it becomes necessary to adopt rules and regulations for the control, abatement, prevention, or reduction of air pollution for more than one region of the Commonwealth, the board may hold one hearing for any two contiguous regions to be affected by such rules and regulations. Such a hearing may be held in either of the two contiguous regions. In cases where it becomes necessary to adopt rules and regulations for the control, abatement, prevention, or reduction of air pollution for any area of the Commonwealth that encompasses more than one region or parts of more than one region, public hearings shall be held in the area concerned. Full stenographic transcripts shall be taken of all public hearings and shall be made available by the department to any party concerned with the subject matter of the hearing upon the payment of prevailing rates for such transcripts.

### Additional Provisions

Except in the case of knowing and willful violations, this term does not include a stationary engineer or technician responsible for the operation, maintenance, repair, or monitoring of equipment and facilities, who often has supervisory and training duties but is not senior management personnel or a corporate officer. Similarly, for purposes of clause (3) of subsection (b) of this section, "a person" does not include an employee carrying out normal activities who is not part of senior management personnel or a corporate officer. For clauses (1) and (2) of subsection (b) and subsection (c) of this section, "a person" does not include an employee carrying out normal activities under orders from the employer.

(g) **Negligence**  
A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and intent of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation.

(a) In addition to proceeding under any other remedy available at law or in equity for a violation of a provision of this act or any rule or...

to pay the same after demand, the amount, together with interest and any costs that may accrue, shall be a lien in favor of the Commonwealth upon the property, both real and personal, of such person, but only after the same has been entered and docketed of record by the prothonotary of the county where such is situated. The department may, at any time, transmit to the prothonotaries of the respective counties certified copies of all such liens, and it shall be the duty of each prothonotary to enter and docket the same of record in his office, and to index the same as judgments are indexed, without requiring the payment of costs as a condition precedent to the entry thereof.

(c) In addition to proceeding under any other remedy available at law or in equity for a violation of any provision of this act or any rule, regulation, order, plan approval, or permit issued pursuant to this act, the department may assess a civil penalty upon a person for such violation. The civil penalty so assessed shall not exceed the amount set forth in subsection (a) for each violation. In determining the amount of the penalty, the department shall consider the factors set forth in subsection (a).

(d) Any person who fails to pay any civil penalty assessed pursuant to this section shall be liable to the Commonwealth for a civil penalty of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per day for each day during which the failure continues. The department may, at its discretion, compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which may be imposed under this section.

(e) The provisions of this section are intended to be supplementary and in addition to any other remedies available to the department or the Commonwealth at law or in equity.

to pay the same after demand, the amount, together with interest and any costs that may accrue, shall constitute a debt of such person, as may be appropriate, to the Clean Air Fund. The debt shall constitute a lien on all property owned by said person when a notice of lien incorporating a description of the property of the person subject to the action is duly filed with the prothonotary of the court of common pleas where the property is located. The prothonotary shall promptly enter upon the civil judgment or order docket, at no cost to the department, the name and address of the person, as may be appropriate, and the amount of the lien as set forth in the notice of lien. Upon entry by the prothonotary, the lien shall attach to the revenues and all real and personal property of the person, whether or not the person is solvent. The notice of lien, filed pursuant to this subsection, which affects the property of the person shall create a lien with priority over all subsequent claims or liens which are filed against the person, but it shall not affect any valid lien, right or interest in the property filed in accordance with established procedure prior to the filing of a notice of lien under this subsection.

The department shall have the authority to order any person causing a public nuisance to abate the public nuisance. In addition, the department or any Commonwealth agency which undertakes to abate a public nuisance may recover the expenses of abatement following the process for assessment and collection of a civil penalty contained in section 9.1.

*(13.1 amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)*

### Section 13.2. Confidential Information

All records, reports, or information obtained by the department or referred to at public hearings under the provisions of this act shall be available to the public, except that upon cause shown by any person that the records, reports, or information, or a particular portion thereof, but not emission data, to which the department has access under the provisions of this act, if made public, would divulge production or sales figures or methods, processes, or production unique to such person or would otherwise tend to affect adversely the competitive position of such person by revealing trade secrets, including intellectual property rights, the department shall consider such record, report, or information, or particular portion thereof confidential in the administration of this act.

Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent disclosure as necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state law or regulation, or as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

### Section 13.6. Suits to Abate Nuisances and Restrain Violations

(a) Any activity or condition declared by this act to be a nuisance or which is otherwise in violation of this act shall be abatable in the manner provided by law or equity for the abatement of public nuisance. In addition, to restrain or prevent any violation of this act or the rules and regulations promulgated under this act, or any plan approval or permit or orders issued by the department, or to restrain the maintenance and threat of public nuisance, suits may be instituted in equity or at law in the name of the Commonwealth upon relation of the Attorney General, the General Counsel, the district attorney of any county, or the solicitor of any municipality affected after notice has first been served upon the Attorney General of the intention of the General Counsel, district attorney, or solicitor to so proceed. Such proceedings may be prosecuted in the Commonwealth Court or in the court of common pleas of the county where the activity has taken place, the condition exists, or the public is affected, and, to that end, jurisdiction is hereby conferred in law and equity upon such courts. Except in cases of emergency where, in the opinion of the court, the exigencies of the case require immediate abatement of the nuisance, the court may, in its decree, fix a reasonable time during which the person responsible for the nuisance may make provision for the abatement of the same.

(b) In cases where the circumstances require it or the public health is endangered, a mandatory preliminary injunction, special injunction, or temporary restraining order may be issued upon the terms prescribed by the court, notice of the application therefor having been given to the defendant in accordance with the rules of equity practice, and, in any such case, the Attorney General, the General Counsel, the district attorney, or the solicitor of any municipality shall not be required to give bond. In any such proceeding, the court shall, upon motion of the Commonwealth, issue a prohibitory or mandatory preliminary injunction if it finds that the defendant is engaging in unlawful conduct as defined by this act or is engaged in conduct which is causing immediate and irreparable harm to the public. In addition to an injunction, the court in such equity proceedings may levy civil penalties in the same manner as the department in accordance with section 9.1.

(c) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, any person may commence a civil action to compel compliance with this act or any rule, regulation, order, or plan approval or permit issued pursuant to this act by any owner or operator alleged to be causing or contributing to a violation of any provision of this act or any rule or regulation promulgated under this act or any plan approval, permit, or order issued by the department. In addition to seeking to compel compliance, any person may request the court to award civil penalties. The court shall use the factors and amounts contained in section 9.1 in awarding civil penalties under this subsection.

### Section 13.6

Penalties shall be paid into the Clean Air Fund established by section 9.2 or be used to prevent air pollution in the county where the violation occurred. Except where 42 Pa.C.S. (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure) requires otherwise, the courts of common pleas shall have jurisdiction of such actions. Such an action may not be commenced if the department has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil action in a Federal or State court or is in litigation before the hearing board to require the alleged violator to comply with this act, any rule or regulation promulgated under this act, or any order, plan approval, or permit issued pursuant to this act. However, in any such action in a Federal or State court or before the hearing board, any person having or representing an interest which is or may be adversely affected may intervene as a matter of right without posting bond.

- **(d)** An action pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may not be commenced prior to sixty (60) days after the plaintiff has given notice in writing of the violation to the department and to any alleged violator.

- **(e)** The sixty (60) day notice provisions of subsection (d) of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, any action pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may be initiated immediately upon written notification to the department in the case where the violation or condition complained of constitutes an imminent threat to the health or safety of the plaintiff or would immediately affect a legal interest of the plaintiff.

- **(f)** The court, in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, may award costs of litigation, including attorney and expert witness fees, to any party whenever the court determines such an award is appropriate. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the court may, if a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction is sought, require the filing of a bond or equivalent security in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.

*(13.6 added July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)*

### Section 14. Severability

The provisions of this act are severable, and if any provision, sentence, clause, section, or part thereof shall be held illegal, invalid, unconstitutional, or inapplicable to any person or circumstances, such illegality, invalidity, unconstitutionality, or inapplicability shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections, or parts of the ordinance or their application to him or to other persons and circumstances. It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that this act would have been adopted if such illegal, invalid, or unconstitutional provision, sentence, clause, section, or part had not been included therein, and if the person or circumstances to which the ordinance or any part thereof is inapplicable had not specifically been exempted therefrom.

### Section 15. Effective Date

This act shall take effect immediately: Provided, however, that the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this act shall be of no effect until one (1) year after the passage of this act.

Dear Secretary Abruzzo:

**DEC 10 2013**

By letter and enclosures dated July 23, 2013, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) an annual ambient air monitoring network plan in accordance with the regulatory requirements of 40 CFR Section 58 - Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. Based on our review, EPA hereby approves PADEP's July 23, 2013 annual ambient air monitoring network plan on the basis that the plan meets the requirements of 40 CFR Part 58.10.

Additionally, 40 CFR Section 58.11(c) requires any changes to the air monitoring network or design of the following air monitoring systems be approved by the EPA Administrator:

- Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Systems (PAMS)
- Particulate Matter Speciation Trends Network (STN)
- The National Core Monitoring Network (NCore)

EPA determined that PADEP's July 23, 2013 annual ambient air monitoring network plan does not require approval from the EPA Administrator because there were no changes to any of the air monitoring systems listed above.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or have your staff contact Mrs. Laura Mohollen, EPA's Pennsylvania Liaison, at (215) 814-3295. For questions regarding this approval action, your staff may contact Ms. Diana Esher, Director, Air Protection Division, at (215) 814-2706.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102

DEC 10 2013

Dear Dr. Schwarz,

By letter and enclosures dated July 1, 2013, the City of Philadelphia Air Management Services (AMS) submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) an annual ambient air monitoring network plan in accordance with the regulatory requirements of 40 CFR Part 58 - Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. Based on our review, EPA partially approves AMS's July 1, 2013 annual ambient air monitoring network plan on the basis that the plan meets the requirements of 40 CFR Part 58.10. EPA also approves your request for exclusion of the PM2.5 continuous FEM data from site 42-101-0004 as per 40 CFR Part 58.11(e).

Additionally, 40 CFR Section 58.11(c) requires any changes to the air monitoring network or design of the following air monitoring systems be approved by the EPA Administrator:

- Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Systems (PAMS)
- Particulate Matter Speciation Trends Network (STN)
- The National Core Monitoring Network (NCore)

EPA determined that AMS's July 1, 2013 annual ambient air monitoring network plan requires a separate approval from the EPA Administrator because of the relocation of the NCore monitoring site. As such, AMS's 2013 monitoring network plan has been forwarded to EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards to complete the approval process.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or have your staff contact Mrs. Laura Mohollen, EPA's Pennsylvania Liaison, at (215) 814-3295. For questions regarding this approval action, your staff may contact Ms. Diana Esher, Director, Air Protection Division, at (215) 814-2706.
